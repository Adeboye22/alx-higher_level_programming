![alt text](https://s3.amazonaws.com/intranet-projects-files/holbertonschool-higher-level_programming+/247/oop-meme.jpg)

In this project, we'll practice object-oriented programming using classes and objects in Python. I learned about attributes, methods, and properties as well as data abstraction, data encapsulation, and information hiding.

The files in this directory are all written in Python programming and executable.
